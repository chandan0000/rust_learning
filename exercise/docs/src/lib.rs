//! A pumpkin is a cultivar of winter squash that is round with smooth,
//!  slightly ribbed skin, and is most often deep yellow to orange in coloration.
//! The thick shell contains the seeds and pulp. The name is most commonly used
//!  for cultivars of Cucurbita pepo, but some cultivars of Cucurbita maxima, C.
//!  argyrosperma, and C. moschata with similar appearance are also sometimes
//! called "pumpkins"
